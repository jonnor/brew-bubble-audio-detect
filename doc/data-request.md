## Announcement

Hi homebrewers,

This sound can be 

Multiple submissions welcomed!
Each submission must be recorded at least 1 hour apart.

The data will be anonymized before publishing.

As a thank you for the help, we will put the name (or nickname, up to you) of each
person that has contributed into the acknowlegements.

We will also be giving away a couple of Plaato Airlock devices.
The winners will be drawn randomly from all of the valid submissions with plopping events.
So more submissions equals higher chances.

## Instructions



Looking for realistic sound from typical brewing conditions,
not hi-fidelity audio.

Make a 1 minute of audio of your airlock during fermentation.
It can be anywhere in the process, from just getting started, to very active CO2 generation, to fading down.
Record in the location where you typically have your brew sitting.
Record using a standard phone/tablet or digital camera.
Record from a distance between 10 cm to 1 meter from airlock.

Try to avoid too much handling noise when operating the phone/camera.

Upload the video to Youtube. Can be Public or Unlisted.
Submit the data via this Google Form.
